<hr>
<!--This section contains two absolute links to the Fleming College Website-->
<p><img src="photos/barklake.jpg" alt="Hayley sitting on a rock" style="width:300px;height:400px;margin:10px">In the spring of 2020, 
  I graduated from the <a href="https://flemingcollege.ca/programs/ecosystem-management-technician">Ecosystem Management Technician </a>
  program at Fleming College. Continuing my education at Fleming College, I am currently enrolled in the 
  <a href="https://flemingcollege.ca/programs/geographic-information-systems-cartographic-specialist">Cartographic Specialist </a> 
  stream of the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) program. I have a passion for both forest and wetland 
  conservation as well as sustainable living practices.  </p>
<p>I currently live in Ottawa, Ontario with my partner and our cat, Clementine. </p>

<section>Hobbies & Interests</section>  
<hr>
<p> In my free time I enjoy hiking and taking photos of the natural world. My favourite subjects are birds and bugs. I also enjoy creating acriic landscape paintings. 
  I hope to bring my creativity and knowledge of colour theory
  into my map design throughout my time in the GIS program at Fleming College.
<br>
In addition to painting and photography, I have been an avid baker my entire life. Lately I am enjoying baking many different types of breads. 
You can usually find me in my kitchen baking something new at least once a week from September to April, not only because I prefer to bake in the colder months, 
but also because baking is my favourite form of stress releif. It awards me a much needed break from school.
My christmas cake is my most requested creation, and I use a recipe that I adapted from my grandmother's recipe she baked every year while I was growing up. 
If I wasn't persuing a career in the environmental and geographical sector, I would love to work in a bakery.</p>
