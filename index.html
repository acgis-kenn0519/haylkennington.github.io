<section>About me</section>
<hr>
<p>In the spring of 2020, I graduated from the Ecosystem Technician program at Fleming College. Continuing my education at Fleming College, I am currently enrolled in the 
  Cartographic Specialist stream of the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) program. I have a passion for both forest and wetland 
  conservation as well as sustainable living practices. My hobbies include nature photography and landscape painting. I hope to bring my creativity and knowledge of colour theory
  into my map design throughout my time in the GIS program at Fleming College. 

<p>I currently live in Ottawa, Ontario. </p>
